# HORISEON Webpage

## Project Title

Refactoring of HTML and CSS code of the Horiseon marketing agency webpage.

## Horiseon Webpage

The webpage provides a brief description of the services the company provides and benefits to the customer. It contains a Navigation Bar, Hero Image, a separate card (three) for each service provided and an additional card listing benefits. See link and screenshot below.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to modify the HTML source code and CSS entries pertaining to the webpage, without changing the application's appearance and functionality. This will incorporate improving the design and structure of both the HTML source code and stylesheet.

The steps taken to perform code refactoring include but are not limited to the following:

- Ensure all navigation links work;
- Ensure HTML source code consists of semantic elements only;
- Create a unique title for web application including a logo;
- Improve structure, including mandatory elements (header, body, main, footer etc.) and natural flow;
- Ensure class names are descriptive;
- The class 'card' or similar to be used when the referring to a card;
- Reduce the number of class's or combine into one where possible;
- Group CSS entries together where the 'property name and property value' entries match;
- Ensure HTML source code and the stylesheet have relevant comments inserted to help the reader understand the code/CSS property.  

By examining code, identifying problems and/or potential improvements, making the modifications whilst monitoring the impact on the web application. This task enforced me to appreciate the importance of being methodical, recording each change made, and taking due care.

## Usage

The Horiseon Webpage is a fully functional web application with all navigation links working correctly. Accessibility has been drastically improved by adding a title with a self-created logo. By having HTML source code that consists of only sematic HTML elements that describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer, the coding performs better and is easier to work with.

The web application coding has less class's, less CSS properties, with unnecessary code or CSS entries removed or combined. Comments have been inserted and the general structure improved. 

The project created a web application with more readable code, reduced complexity and improved usability. By rewriting the code it is now easier to maintain, make changes and extend features.

While making the changes to HTML source code and/or stylesheet in Visual Studio Code, I was able to use the functions 'Open with LIVE Server' and 'Inspect' which enabled me to view the impact on the web application's appearance in real time, and test the navigation links on a regular basis.
